## 1. Standard Streams in C and C++
In C and C++, three predefined text streams are provided, each with the type `FILE *`:
- **`stdin`**: Standard input stream.
- **`stdout`**: Standard output stream, used for conventional output.
- **`stderr`**: Standard error stream, used for diagnostic output.

## 2. Command-line Interface
- Historically, the command-line interface was the only interface available for interacting with computers.
- Even in the 21st century, command-line interfaces are still essential:
  - Many computers lack a graphical user interface (GUI), such as servers and embedded devices.
  - Many programs do not provide a GUI, such as HTTP servers and database servers.

## 3. Output and Error Streams
In C and C++, content can be sent to different streams:
- **C Style**:
  ```c
  fprintf(stdout, "Info: ...\n", ...);
  printf("Info: ... \n", ...); // Default to stdout
  fprintf(stderr, "Error: ...\n", ...);
  ```
- **C++ Style**:
  ```cpp
  std::cout << "Info: ..." << std::endl;
  std::cerr << "Error: ..." << std::endl;
  ```

## 4. Redirection
- The output of a program can be redirected for debugging or logging purposes:
  - `./program 2> error.log`: Redirect `stderr` to a file.
  - `./program > output.log 2> error.log`: Redirect `stdout` and `stderr` to separate files.
  - `./program &> all.log`: Redirect both `stdout` and `stderr` to the same file.
  - `./program > all.log 2>&1`: Redirect `stderr` to the same destination as `stdout`.
  - `./program | less`: Pipe the output to another program.
  - `./program > output.log`: Redirect `stdout` to a file.
  - `./program >> output.log`: Append the output to a file.
  - `./program > /dev/null`: Discard the output.

## 5. Importance of Command-line Interfaces
Despite the prevalence of GUIs, command-line interfaces remain crucial for:
- **Server Management**: Many servers operate without a GUI.
- **Scripting and Automation**: Command-line tools are essential for scripting and automating tasks.
- **Debugging and Logging**: Redirecting output streams allows for efficient debugging and logging of program behavior.
